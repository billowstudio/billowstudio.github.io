### Welcome
Follow is a powerful app which tracks the number of followers to channels and informs you in real time.
The best thing about Follow is that you can keep track of more than 1 channel at once.
Our app will save you a lot of time and energy because you don’t have to log in to your account a couple of times in a day just to see your progress. Follow is also FREE, so download our app and try it now!
